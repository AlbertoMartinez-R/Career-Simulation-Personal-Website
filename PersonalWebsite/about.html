                <p> Diving into the fascinating realm of MedTech, I've been on an incredible journey with Johnson & Johnson for the past three years.
                    As a technician in this cutting-edge department, I find myself at the intersection of technology and healthcare, 
                    crafting the future with my own hands. While I must tread lightly on the specifics, let me intrigue you with this: 
                    my days are spent giving life to robots. This passion for innovation fuels my ambition, steering me towards a quest in coding.

                    I like joining events that are about anime, also I enjoy videogames. On a non-popular opinion I think videogames are good for any generation. I am not going to lie and say they are 100% good but I have learned so much from them. 
                    Some videogames teach you a lot, mostly softskills, like being patient, or resurseful, sometimes help you to think outside the box. Here a list of other things I have learned from videogames:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How to set up servers to play with friends</li>
                    <li>Learn to adapt to different groups of people</li>
                    <li>A little bit of coding to be able to run games</li>
                    <li>Create multiple strategies to meet a goal</li>
                </ul>
